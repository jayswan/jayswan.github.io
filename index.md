## About Jay Swan

### Professional World:
Infosec and networks. Today I work mostly on investigations, threat intelligence, and security data analytics. Some of my favorite things are Python, Jupyter notebooks, Presto, Zeek, NetFlow, passive DNS, and BGP. In the past I've worked extensively in network engineering, especially on WAN, VPN, VoIP, industrial networks, and small data center environments in the energy industry.

### Cultural World:
I'm interested in a lot of humanities topics, including philosophy, poetry, science fiction, history of science, and military history. I have many favorite writers, but a sampling would include: H.D., Virginia Woolf, Daniel Dennett, Frank Herbert, Rebecca Newberger Goldstein.

### Physical World:
I practice trail running, mountain biking, and weight training fairly seriously, but I'm not great at any of them. In the past I studied a variety of martial arts for a long time.
