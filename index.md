### Historical Notes
For many years this blog lived (and still does, unmaintained) at http://unroutable.blogspot.com. I got sick of Blogger and enamored of GitHub, so here it lives now. I don't have time to search for problems from the Blogger to GitHub Pages migration, but if you find something that really bothers you, let me know via Twitter.
