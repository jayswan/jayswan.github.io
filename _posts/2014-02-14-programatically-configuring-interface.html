I wrote some Python code that allows you to do the following:<br /><ol><li>Query a Catalyst switch CDP neighbor table from its HTTPS interface,</li><li>Extract the device names of the attached IP phones,</li><li>Query Communications Manager for the IP phone device description,&nbsp;</li><li>Apply the device description as the switch interface description.</li></ol>Obviously, this makes it much easier to see whose phone is attached to a switch port.<br /><br />I hope that this example saves someone the head-banging that I incurred while trying to figure out the AXL XML/SOAP API for Communications Manager.<br /><br />I haven't tested this extensively; all my testing has been on Catalyst 3560 and 3750 switches and CUCM version 8.6. Using the --auto switch to automatically configure the switch is quite slow; this is a limitation of the HTTPS interface rather than the script code. It may be faster to leave that option off and manually copy/paste the printed configuration if you're in a hurry.<br /><br />Note that your switch must be configured to allow configuration via the HTTPS interface; you may need to modify your TACACS/etc. configurations accordingly.<br /><br />All the relevant info is in the <a href="https://github.com/jayswan/cdp_cucm" target="_blank">Github repo</a>.
