<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">A friend of mine recently told me that I "have a hang-up about the meanings of words".</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Guilty as charged. I just read yet another press release that uses the idiotic expression "best-of-breed"--I'm at the point where seeing that phrase makes me want to throw a rock at the monitor.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Here's a simple test for a CorporateSpeak buzzphrase: could you say the opposite, without sounding like a crazy person? If not, then your buzzphrase is meaningless. For example:</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>"Best-of-Breed Vendors Offer Tested and Validated Solutions for Multiple Cisco VXI Deployment Options" </b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Now, try the opposite:</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>"Mediocre Vendors With More Successful Competitors Offer Tested and Validated Solutions for Multiple Cisco VXI Deployment Options" </b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">or</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>"Worst-of-Breed Vendors Offer Tested and  Validated Solutions for Multiple Cisco VXI Deployment Options" </b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">No sane person would write that. Thus, the result of the test is that the changed phrase, "best-of-breed", obscures rather than enhances meaning.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Another one I hear all the time is <i>"IT should work to serve the needs of the business."</i> This one doesn't have any suspicious buzzphrases in it, but it's still completely meaningless: can you imagine saying "<i>IT should <b>not </b>work to serve the needs of the business"</i>? Of course not; you'd sound insane. Compare that with a similar, but meaningful and concrete sentence: <i>"IT should work to reduce costs by improving the performance of the accounting servers."</i> With this sentence, IT is still "serving the needs of the business", but you could clearly state the opposite and still have meaning: one could certainly argue that IT's efforts are better spent in areas other than accounting without sounding crazy.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">One final example from a friend at a software firm. He received this in email from a guy in sales:</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>"We need to write software that customers want to buy."</i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The utter poverty of meaning in that waste of bits is left as an exercise for the reader.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Now, I realize that these sorts of expressions have purposes other than enhancing meaning: they might serve to solicit agreement from the reader as a prelude to a more controversial assertion, or they might simply be not-so-subtle attempts at <strike>marketing </strike>tricking the reader into a positive first impression. I don't really accept those excuses, though: rational people seek to create meaning, not to obscure it. Get into the habit of troubleshooting your meaning. One way is to test the opposite.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Endnote:</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I have no idea if this idea is original or not. It seems like a simple enough idea that I may have gotten it from someone else, but if so, I don't remember and can't attribute the source.</div>
