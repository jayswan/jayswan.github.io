A few days ago I posted an amusing comment on Ivan Pepelnjak's always excellent <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/">Cisco IOS Hints and Tricks </a>blog, and he found it funny enough to create a <a href="http://blog.ioshints.info/2009/12/ten-steps-of-small-lan-design.html">separate post</a>. I'll repeat my ten step program here for future reference:<br /><br /><ol><li>   Build everything at layer 2 because "it's simpler".</li><li>   Scale a little.</li><li>   Things start breaking mysteriously. Run around in circles. Learn about packet sniffers and STP.</li><li>   Learn about layer 3 features in switches you already own. Start routing.</li><li>   Scale more.</li><li>   Things start breaking mysteriously. Learn about TCAMs. Start wishing for NetFlow.</li><li>   Redesign. Buy stuff.</li><li>   Scale more.</li><li>   VMWare jockeys start asking about bridging across the WAN.</li><li>  Enroll in hair loss program.</li></ol>
