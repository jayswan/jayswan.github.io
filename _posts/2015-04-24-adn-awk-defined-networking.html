Because I have yet to transition to a completely software-defined network in which everything configures itself (wink wink), I still have to do tasks like bulk VLAN changes.<br /><br />Thanks to a recent innovation called ADN, or "AWK Defined Networking", I can do this in a shorter time window that the average bathroom break. For example, I just had a request to change all ports on a large access switch stack that&nbsp; are currently in VLAN 76 to VLAN 64:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"># <b>ssh switch_name.foo.com 'show int status | i _76_' | grep Gi | awk '{print "int ",$1,"\n","description PC/Phone","\n","switchport access vlan 64"}'</b><br />Password: ***</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">int&nbsp; Gi1/0/25<br />&nbsp;description PC/Phone<br />&nbsp;switchport access vlan 64<br />int&nbsp; Gi1/0/26<br />&nbsp;description PC/Phone<br />&nbsp;switchport access vlan 64</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">[many more deleted] </span><br /><br />Then I copied and pasted the results into config mode. Back to lounging on the beach.<br /><br /><a href="http://ferd.ca/awk-in-20-minutes.html" target="_blank">Not even any Python skills required!</a>
