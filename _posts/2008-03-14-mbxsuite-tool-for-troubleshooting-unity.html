I recently learned about a useful tool for troubleshooting Unity/Exchange mailbox issues. It's located in the \CommServer\TechTools folder, and it's called MBXSuite.exe.<br /><br />To use it:<br /><br />1) Select the user whose mailbox you want to test with.<br />2) Select the Unity service account you want to run as--usually UnityMsgStoreSvc.<br />3) Check "Verbose Diags"<br />4) Click "Logon Mailbox" and check the Diagnostics pane for errors.
