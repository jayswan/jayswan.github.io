### Historical Notes
For many years this blog lived (and still does, unmaintained) at http://unroutable.blogspot.com. I got tired of Blogger and enamored of GitHub, so here it lives now. I haven't done a lot of searching for format problems related to the Blogger to GitHub Pages migration, so if you find something that really bothers you, let me know via Twitter.
