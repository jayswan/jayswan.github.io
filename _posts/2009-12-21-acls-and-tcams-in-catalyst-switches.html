One of the things you need to look at when designing networks with Catalyst switches is the potential for TCAM exhaustion due to ACL and QoS configuration. Here are a couple of documents that explain the issue:<br /><br />Catalyst 6500<br /><a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps708/products_white_paper09186a00800c9470.shtml">http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps708/products_white_paper09186a00800c9470.shtml</a><br /><br />Catalyst 4500 and 4900 Series<br /><a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps663/products_tech_note09186a008054a499.shtml">http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps663/products_tech_note09186a008054a499.shtml</a>
