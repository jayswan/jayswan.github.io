I've been doing Cisco IDS/IPS stuff recently for the first time in a long while. If you haven't tried Cisco's new free IPS Manager Express application, check it out. It makes IDS/IPS event monitoring and management reasonably useful and almost pain-free. The interface is much more intuitive that other Cisco IDS/IPS GUI products. The only problem is that the current version supports only 5 sensors; supposedly this will increase in a future release.<br /><br />Added 12/15/09:<br />The latest version of IME supports 10 sensors.
