I enjoyed Ethan Banks' post on <a href="http://ethancbanks.com/2013/12/29/new-years-thoughts-start-with-documentation/" target="_blank">New Year's Thoughts: Start with Documentation</a>, so I thought I'd write about what I'm doing this week: code cleanup. Over the last couple of years I've written a decent amount of code to automate mundane network management tasks. As quick one-off hacks have turned into things that I actually depend on, I've noticed a lot of ugliness that I want to fix.<br /><br />Everything here is assuming Python as the language of choice:<br /><ul><li>For scripts that send email, check to make sure the list of mail receivers is up-to-date.</li><li>Look for those nasty embedded IP addresses and replace them with DNS names. </li><li>Change from old-style <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file-objects" target="_blank"><i>open(FILE)/close(FILE)</i> constructs to <i>with open(FILE) as f</i> constructs</a>.</li><li>Get rid of "pickles" for persistent structured data storage. <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html" target="_blank">Pickles</a> are a form of native Python object serialization that are quick and convenient, but have a lot of potential problems. I've mostly used Python's native <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html" target="_blank">SQLite3</a> library to store data in simple persistent databases, but occasionally I just use plain text files.</li><li>Look for repetitive code in the main script logic and try to move it into functions or classes where possible. For example, I had several scripts that were building email reports via clunky string concatenation, so I created a Report class that knows how to append to itself and do simple formatting.</li><li>Remove unused module imports (that were usually there for debugging).</li><li>Standardize module imports, declaration of constants, etc.</li><li>Add more comments!</li><li>Remove old code that was commented out for whatever reason.</li><li>Look for places where I was creating huge lists in memory and try to figure out a way to reduce memory consumption with <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html?highlight=generator#generator-iterator-methods" target="_blank">generators</a>.</li></ul>Things I haven't done, but probably should:<br /><ul><li>Change to new-style <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language" target="_blank">string formatting</a>.</li><li>Write some tests, particularly for log parsers.</li><li>Migrate from <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/optparse.html" target="_blank">optparse</a> to <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html" target="_blank">argparse</a> for handling CLI flags. </li></ul>Things I haven't done, and probably never will:<br /><ul><li>&nbsp;Migrate to <a href="http://alexgaynor.net/2013/dec/30/about-python-3/" target="_blank">Python 3</a>.</li></ul>
