I just went to the 2012 BroExchange, the conference for users of <a href="http://www.bro-ids.org/index.html">Bro-IDS</a>. I am almost completely new to Bro, but had a great time learning from some seriously smart folks. Here's a random linkfest of stuff:<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/grigorescu/Brownian">Brownian</a>, a web front-end to an <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch </a>back-end for Bro logs.<br /><a href="https://code.google.com/p/auditing-sshd/">auditing-sshd</a>, a version of OpenSSH that exports user activity data to Bro (or other log infra, I suppose)<br /><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">parallel</a>, a GNU tool for executing shell jobs in parallel.<br /><a href="http://www.cpacket.com/">cpacket</a>, maker of mirror switches, similar to <a href="http://www.gigamon.com/">Gigamon</a>.<br /><a href="https://github.com/sethhall">Bro developer Seth Hall's github page</a><br />The awesome <a href="http://securityonion.blogspot.com/">Security Onion Linux distro</a> with Bro pre-installed.<br /><br />I may add more as I decipher my notes.
